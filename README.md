## Introduction
This project was part of Lambda School's Build Week projects.  During this week, students from different points in the Full Stack Web Development curriculum come together as small teams to demonstrate mastery over the material they've learned thus far.

This was my first Build Week at Lambda School, and as such, my role was Web UI Developer.  My responsibility in the project was to build a marketing landing page that links to my team's application.

## Project Background:

SAFE serves mothers in Uganda to improve maternal and child survival.  One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot). Can you imagine trying to walk an hour on foot when you were pregnant, and in labor? SAFE provides motorcycle ambulances to improve this problem, but mothers have a hard time contacting them in time. This app identifies and sends a text to the nearest motorcycle ambulance driver.

## Project MVP Requirements

This app contains two user types. A ride requester (pregnant mom, or their caregiver) and a trained motorcycle ambulance drive.

1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)
2. On-boarding process for driver (create their profile with name, location, and price)
3. Ability for driver to edit and delete their profile
4. Ability for user easily create, edit and delete driver reviews.
5. Ability for user to search for drivers based on their location and view their profile page.

## My Responsibilities:

1. Build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
2. Marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths.
3. The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that the team's Front End Architect is building.
4. Marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform.
5. Marketing site's home page must have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.
